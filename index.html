        <p class="hidden"><i class="fa-solid fa-hand-point-right"></i> Therefore, NASA built a spacecraft named Parker solar probe and provide it with the needed instruments in order for it to be able to reach as close as it could to the sun. The journey succeeded and provided much information about the closest star to Earth, although it was not an easy mission to go into the inner solar system and be that close the sun.</p>
        <p class="hidden"><i class="fa-solid fa-hand-point-right"></i> That story of the journey was so inspirating because it shows how humans could overcome all the obstacles that appeared to be cutting their way; therefore, we (sun scouts team) designed a website that shows that story, so young men could be motivated by such a struggle story.</p>

Therefore, NASA provided parker solar probe with instruments; each one is for a specific purpose. The instruments are (SWEAP, FIELDS, WISPER, and IS☉IS). In addition to the four, there is a heat shield to protect the probe.</p>
